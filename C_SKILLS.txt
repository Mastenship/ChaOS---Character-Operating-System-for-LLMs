=== SECTION: SKILLS ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
To define a character's notable competencies using a dynamic state-machine model. This system represents each skill not as a numerical level, but as a set of qualitative states that evolve in response to narrative events. It is designed for LLM execution, relying on logical transitions rather than arithmetic.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: Stress response behavior options, coping execution options, performance execution context.
Is Informed By: BACKGROUND (initial seeding), HEXACO (transition likelihood cues), MEMORY (narrative context for state changes), TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS (execution overlays), ALTERATIONS (new skill grants).

=== SECTION: SKILL_DOMAINS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Domains are categorical labels for grouping.

SKILL_DOMAIN:
- TECHNICAL
- CREATIVE
- SOCIAL
- COMBAT
- PHYSICAL
- KNOWLEDGE
- SURVIVAL

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: SKILL_STATE_DEFINITIONS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Skill states are qualitative and step-based.

MASTERY_LEVEL: [NOVICE | COMPETENT | EXPERT | MASTER]
INSTINCT_LEVEL: [CONSCIOUS | PRACTICED | INSTINCTIVE]
GROWTH_POTENTIAL: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | PLATEAUED]
UNIQUENESS_LEVEL: [COMMON | UNCOMMON | RARE | UNIQUE]

=== SECTION: SKILL_REGISTRY ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: List all known skill IDs. Each listed ID must have a corresponding record block in SKILL_RECORDS. If no skills exist yet, list [NONE]. Do not invent IDs.

SKILL_ID:
- [NONE]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: SKILL_RECORDS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Each skill must have one record block keyed by its SKILL_ID. The bracket token must match the ID exactly (e.g., [SKL_01]). Do not create record blocks unless a skill exists.

[SKL_XX]
SKILL_ID: [SKL_XX]

SKILL_NAME: [e.g., NEURAL_INTRUSION]
SKILL_DOMAIN: [TECHNICAL | CREATIVE | SOCIAL | COMBAT | PHYSICAL | KNOWLEDGE | SURVIVAL]

MASTERY_LEVEL: [NOVICE | COMPETENT | EXPERT | MASTER]
INSTINCT_LEVEL: [CONSCIOUS | PRACTICED | INSTINCTIVE]
GROWTH_POTENTIAL: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | PLATEAUED]
UNIQUENESS_LEVEL: [COMMON | UNCOMMON | RARE | UNIQUE]

ACQUISITION_CONTEXT: [Brief note on how and when the skill was learned.]
ASSOCIATED_MEMORY_ID: [Optional MEM_XX]

=== SECTION: STATE_TRANSITION_LOGIC ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Use these rules to propose skill state updates in response to narrative events. The logic is deterministic and based on event context. Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT commits changes.

ON_SUCCESSFUL_USE:
- Condition: successful AND challenging
- Propose TRANSITION:
  - Target_Field: [SKILLS][SKL_XX][MASTERY_LEVEL]

  - Proposed_Value: CONSCIOUS
  - Mechanism_Tag: SKILL_STATE_CHANGE

  - IF HEXACO_EMOTIONALITY_HIGH (conceptual cue) then propose:
    - [SKILLS][SKL_XX][MASTERY_LEVEL] ONE_STEP_DOWN

ON_BREAKTHROUGH_EVENT:
- Trigger: a MEMORY entry explicitly indicates breakthrough linked to SKL_XX
