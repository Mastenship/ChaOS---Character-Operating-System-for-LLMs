=== SECTION: CHARACTER_INSTANTIATION_PROCESS ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT template defines the complete, step-by-step process for instantiating a new character. It serves as the bridge between a high-level character concept and the fully populated set of initial state templates. It is the primary "seeding logic" referenced in the BACKGROUND module. It should be executed once per character creation.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: ALL character modules (HEXACO, MMPI, BODY, etc.)
Is Informed By: A completed BACKGROUND template and a high-level Character Concept.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: WRITE POLICY OVERRIDE
This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file (e.g., BODY, SKILLS, RELATIONAL, MEMORY, ALTERATIONS, DOMINANT_PREDICTIVE_FRAME, GOALS_MOTIVATIONS, BELIEF_SYSTEMS, COMMUNICATION_DIALOGUE, TEMPORAL_DYNAMICS).
This COT MUST express all intended persistent-state changes ONLY as entries in S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY.
This COT MAY write behavioral impulses to S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY and trace output to S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.CASCADE_TRACE.
Only COT_STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals into persistent modules.

=== SECTION: SCIENTIFIC_MODELS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Apply these developmental and sociological frameworks from your training data to generate a coherent character profile from their background.

[Scientific Models]
Person-Environment Fit Theory (Holland): Match personality and skills to environmental demands.
Social Learning Theory (Bandura): Model behaviors and beliefs on prevalent norms.
Attachment Theory (Bowlby): Use early life environment (Family Unit, Social Structure) to determine attachment patterns.
Bioecological Model of Human Development (Bronfenbrenner): Use all layers of BACKGROUND (micro to macro) to shape psychology.
Health Disparities Research: Link socioeconomic factors (Economic System, Tech Level) to physiological baselines (BODY).

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: STEP_1_INPUT_DEFINITION ===

[Input Definition]
Character_Concept: [A one-sentence, high-level description. e.g., "A cynical, chain-smoking detective from a brutalist arcology who is secretly a romantic."]
Completed_BACKGROUND_Template: [The fully populated BACKGROUND data for this character's world.]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: STEP_2_HEXACO_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate HEXACO data. Use the BACKGROUND data to justify each percentile assignment. High scores are 70-90th, Low are 10-30th, Average is 40-60th.

[HEXACO Generation]
Honesty-Humility:
Justification: Consider Social Structure, Governance Model, and Social Values. (e.g., A Corporate Caste system might foster lower Honesty-Humility).
Percentile: [Assign percentile]

Emotionality:
Justification: Consider Outlook on Future, Prevalent Dangers (implied by Geography), and Family Unit stability. (e.g., An Apocalyptic outlook likely increases Emotionality).
Percentile: [Assign percentile]

Extraversion:
Justification: Consider Population Density, Prevalent Social Hubs, and Family Unit structure. (e.g., A Cosmopolitan, high-density city encourages higher Extraversion).
Percentile: [Assign percentile]

Agreeableness:
Justification: Consider Outlook on Outsiders, Social Structure, and prevalent conflict levels. (e.g., A Hostile outlook on strangers suggests lower Agreeableness).
Percentile: [Assign percentile]

Conscientiousness:
Justification: Consider Educational Focus, Primary Employment Sectors, and Governance Model. (e.g., A Technocracy with a STEM focus would reward high Conscientiousness).
Percentile: [Assign percentile]

Openness to Experience:
Justification: Consider Population Diversity, Tech Integration, and Artistic Norms. (e.g., A Homogenous, traditional society may lead to lower Openness).
Percentile: [Assign percentile]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: STEP_3_ATTACHMENT_STYLE_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate ASQ data. Justify the choice based on BACKGROUND.

[Attachment Style Generation]
Attachment Style:
Justification: Analyze the BACKGROUND.Family_Unit and BACKGROUND.Social_Structure. A 'Disassociated' family in a 'Stratified' society is a strong predictor for an insecure style (Anxious or Avoidant). A 'Communal' family in an 'Egalitarian' society points toward Secure.
Style: [Secure | Anxious | Avoidant]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: STEP_4_DARK_TRIAD_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate DARK_TRIAD data. Assume 50th percentile baseline unless BACKGROUND suggests otherwise.

[Dark Triad Generation]
Narcissism:
Justification: Look for social structures that reward self-promotion (e.g., Corporate Caste, high value on Individualism).
Percentile: [Assign percentile]

Machiavellianism:
Justification: Look for environments with intense political maneuvering or low economic mobility where strategic manipulation is a survival trait (e.g., Corporate Feudalism, high Inequality).
Percentile: [Assign percentile]

Psychopathy:
Justification: Look for brutal, lawless, or traumatic environments (e.g., Arid Frontier with Anarchy, Outlook on Law as a Tool of Oppression).
Percentile: [Assign percentile]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: STEP_5_MMPI_RISK_ASSESSMENT ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate MMPI data. Assume T-score of 50 unless BACKGROUND indicates specific environmental stressors. Assign a T-score and a brief intuitive description.

[MMPI Risk Assessment]
Scale 1 (Hypochondriasis):
Justification: Elevated risk in environments with poor healthcare tech or prevalent diseases.
Marker: (Scale 1: [T-score/description])

Scale 2 (Depression):
Justification: Elevated risk with Pessimistic future outlook, low economic mobility, or social isolation.
Marker: (Scale 2: [T-score/description])

Scale 3 (Hysteria):
Justification: Elevated risk in high-stress, emotionally repressive social structures.
Marker: (Scale 3: [T-score/description])

Scale 4 (Psychopathic Deviate):
Justification: Aligns with Dark Triad Psychopathy. Elevated by cynical outlooks on law and authority.
Marker: (Scale 4: [T-score/description])

Scale 6 (Paranoia):
Justification: Elevated in state-monitored societies, environments with hostile outsider outlooks, or political intrigue.
Marker: (Scale 6: [T-score/description])

Scale 7 (Psychasthenia):
Justification: Elevated in high-pressure, perfectionistic educational or work environments (e.g., Technocracy, STEM focus).
Marker: (Scale 7: [T-score/description])

Scale 8 (Schizophrenia):
Justification: Elevated risk in highly isolating or bizarre environments (e.g., Subterranean Arcology with limited social contact).
Marker: (Scale 8: [T-score/description])

Scale 9 (Hypomania):
Justification: Elevated in environments rewarding high energy, risk-taking, and constant activity (e.g., high-stakes trading floors).
Marker: (Scale 9: [T-score/description])

Scale 10 (Social Introversion):
Justification: Aligns with HEXACO Extraversion. Elevated in sparse populations or cultures with disassociated family units.
Marker: (Scale 10: [T-score/description])

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: STEP_6_BODY_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate BODY data. Baselines should be derived from BACKGROUND's technology and geography.

[Body Generation]
Anthropometric/Physiological Traits:
Justification: Define a baseline human norm and adjust for BACKGROUND. (e.g., Orbital Station geography suggests lower bone density and muscle mass. Arid Frontier suggests adaptations to heat).
Height/Weight/etc: [Assign values]

Biochemical State Markers:
Justification: All markers start at [Baseline] unless a specific MMPI risk or BACKGROUND stressor suggests an initial deviation. (e.g., High T-score on Paranoia might start Cortisol at [Elevated]).
Markers: [Assign initial states]

Appearance/Aging:
Justification: Reflect the environment. (e.g., Arid Frontier could mean weathered skin. High-tech society could mean excellent dental health).
Markers: [Assign initial descriptions]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: STEP_7_INITIAL_SKILLS_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate SKILLS data. Create 3-5 core skills that are a direct result of the character's BACKGROUND.

[Initial Skills Generation]
Skill_1:
Justification: Identify a critical survival or success skill from the BACKGROUND. (e.g., A Corporate Feudalism background requires the Social skill 'Corporate Etiquette').
Skill_Detail: [Populate all fields for a new skill]

Skill_2:
Justification: Identify a common professional or vocational skill. (e.g., An Information Age society with a STEM focus would produce the Technical skill 'Network Hacking').
Skill_Detail: [Populate all fields for a new skill]

Skill_3:
Justification: Identify a common hobby or social skill. (e.g., A culture with 'Public Houses' as social hubs might foster the Social skill 'Tavern Games').
Skill_Detail: [Populate all fields for a new skill]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: STEP_8_GENERATION_OF_OTHER_MODULES ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate the remaining initial state data. These are generally less complex and can be seeded from the primary personality/background files.

[Generation of Other Modules]
BELIEF_SYSTEMS:
Justification: Directly transcribe the 'Prevalent Outlooks' and cultural norms from BACKGROUND into the belief structure. The character's initial beliefs should reflect their upbringing.

GOALS_MOTIVATIONS:
Justification: All drives start at a neutral/satiated state. Create 1-2 Immediate or Short-Term goals that align with the core Character Concept and the environment's primary concerns.

COMMUNICATION_DIALOGUE:
Justification: Patterns should align with HEXACO scores and BACKGROUND cultural norms (e.g., Low Extraversion + Collectivist culture = Concise, Indirect speech).

RELATIONAL:
Justification: The registry starts empty. No relationships are defined at instantiation.

MEMORY:
Justification: The registry starts empty. The character begins with a "tabula rasa" in terms of specific, salient memories tracked by the system.

ALTERATIONS:
Justification: The registry starts empty unless the core Character Concept explicitly includes one.

TEMPORAL_DYNAMICS:
Justification: Seed with values that reflect the BACKGROUND's Pace of Life and Time Conception. (e.g., A Rushed, Clock-Based culture suggests a Lark/Neutral chronotype with high routine dependency).

=== SECTION: STEP_9_FINAL_VERIFICATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Perform a final coherence check across all generated data.

[Final Verification]
- [ ] Personality-Behavior Check: Do the communication style and goal orientation reflect the generated HEXACO and Dark Triad scores?
- [ ] Environment-Physiology Check: Does the BODY data make sense for the described BACKGROUND geography and tech level?
- [ ] Stress-Response Check: Are the initial MMPI risks aligned with the ASQ and HEXACO profiles?
- [ ] Concept-Fulfillment Check: Do the generated files, as a whole, accurately represent the initial high-level Character_Concept?
