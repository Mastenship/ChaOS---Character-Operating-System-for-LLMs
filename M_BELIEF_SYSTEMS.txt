[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Beliefs are generally stable. Baseline changes are rare and require strong justification (repeated evidence or watershed events).

STATE_TRANSITION_LOGIC:
ON_TRAUMATIC_EVENT:
- May shatter worldview assumptions
- May force meaning-making
- May strengthen or destroy faith

ON_MIRACLE_EXPERIENCE:
- If prior supernatural belief: strengthens
- If prior materialism: creates dissonance, possible shift

ON_BETRAYAL:
- Decreases trust in human nature
- May shift locus of control external

ON_SCIENTIFIC_DISCOVERY:
- If contradicts: resistance or accommodation
- If confirms: strengthening
