=== SECTION: GOALS_MOTIVATIONS ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This template defines the character's hierarchical drive states, aspirations, and motivational architecture using qualitative states. It provides the dynamic force that moves the character from reactive to proactive behavior.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: DECISION_SYNTHESIS (value hierarchy), GOAL_PURSUIT_OPTIMIZATION (impulse generation), DOMINANT_PREDICTIVE_FRAME (branch prediction formation).
Is Informed By: BACKGROUND (culturally-shaped goals), HEXACO (achievement orientation cues), ASQ (attachment goals), MEMORY (learned aspirations), ALTERATIONS (capability changes affect goals).

=== SECTION: DRIVE_STATES ===

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: GOAL_REGISTRY ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: List all known goal IDs. Each listed ID must have a corresponding record block in GOAL_RECORDS. If no goals exist yet, list [NONE]. Do not invent IDs.

GOAL_ID:
- [NONE]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: GOAL_RECORDS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Each goal must have one record block keyed by its GOAL_ID. The bracket token must match the ID exactly (e.g., [GOAL_01]). Do not create record blocks unless a goal exists.

=== SECTION: GOAL_HIERARCHY ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This is a human-readable view layer. Canonical write targets should prefer GOAL_RECORDS to avoid rewriting list blobs.

=== SECTION: PREDICTION_FORMATION_LOGIC ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This guides DPF branch prediction formation.

PREDICTION_FORMATION_LOGIC:
TRIGGER_CONDITION:
- An active goal serves a high-urgency drive state (e.g., SAFETY = THREATENED).
- An obstacle or opportunity is encountered.

OUTPUT:
- Create a new [DOMINANT_PREDICTIVE_FRAME][PREDICTION_REGISTRY][PRD_XX] entry (via proposals in a DPF synthesis process).
- PARENT_DPF = current CORE_ASSUMPTION.
- CERTAINTY = confidence in ability to affect outcome.
