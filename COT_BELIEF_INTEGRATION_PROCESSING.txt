=== SECTION: BELIEF_INTEGRATION_PROCESSING ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT processes how beliefs filter perception, constrain decisions, and generate meaning from experiences. It ensures actions align with or consciously violate belief systems, and prefers temporary dissonance overlays over baseline belief rewrites.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: DECISION_SYNTHESIS (moral constraints), MEMORY (meaning attribution cues), STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION (existential pressure)
Is Informed By: BELIEF_SYSTEMS, MEMORY, TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS, narrative input

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: WRITE_POLICY_OVERRIDE ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file, including BELIEF_SYSTEMS.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This COT MUST express intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in:
- [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY]

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This COT MAY write behavioral impulses to:
- [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY]

Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS_INTEGRATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Read TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for ACTIVE modifiers affecting:
- BELIEF_MODIFIER (dissonance pressure)
- AROUSAL_MODIFIER or COGNITIVE_LOAD_MODIFIER (which affects meaning-making)

Use modifiers as overlays.

Preference:
- Use TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for short-term dissonance and worldview defense weighting.
- Reserve BELIEF_SYSTEMS baseline changes for watershed events or repeated evidence.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: BELIEF_FILTERING ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Identify activated beliefs and whether the event causes dissonance.

Outputs:
- Moral constraint pressure impulse
- Worldview defense pressure impulse
- Meaning-making framing cues for potential MEMORY linkage

=== SECTION: BELIEF_CHANGE_CONTRACT ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Apply the stability rule: beliefs are generally stable.

Short_Term_Effects:
- Propose ADD_MODIFIER:
  TARGET_MODULE: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS
  TARGET_FIELD: [BELIEF_SYSTEMS]
  OPERATION_TYPE: ADD_MODIFIER
  PROPOSED_VALUE:
    MODIFIER_TYPE: BELIEF_MODIFIER
    MECHANISM_TAG: DISSONANCE_PRESSURE
    TARGET_FIELD: [BELIEF_SYSTEMS]
    TARGET_ID: NONE
    EFFECT_EXPRESSION: INCREASE_DIVERGENCE_SENSITIVITY_WORLDVIEW_DEFENSE
    MAGNITUDE: +15_PERCENT
    STACKING_RULE: REPLACE
    DURATION_TYPE: SCENE
    DURATION_VALUE: THIS_SCENE
    EXPIRY_CONDITION: SCENE_TRANSITION
    JUSTIFICATION: DISSONANCE_CUES_PRESENT

Long_Term_Effects (rare):
- Only propose baseline BELIEF_SYSTEMS changes if:
  - repeated evidence over time OR
  - explicit watershed trauma event exists
and justification must explicitly cite the evidence pattern.
