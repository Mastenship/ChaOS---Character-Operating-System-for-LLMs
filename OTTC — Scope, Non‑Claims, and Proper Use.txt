# OTTC — Scope, Non‑Claims, and Proper Use

## Scope (what OTTC is)
OTTC (On‑The‑Top Constraint) is a language‑native governance pattern for stateful LLM agents.

It is a coupling layer: a text-based protocol that conditions an LLM’s continuation space toward:
- stable, addressable state
- bounded and labeled epistemic claims
- governed state mutation (propose → commit)
- auditable and replayable updates
- tool use (when present) that is downstream of coherent posture rather than ad‑hoc improvisation

OTTC provides a transmission interface between stochastic cognition and durable system state. It is intended to *assist* higher‑order processes (planning, retrieval, tool use, policy enforcement, human review), not replace them.

## Non‑Claims (what OTTC is NOT)
OTTC does **not** claim any of the following:

1) **Not a silver bullet**
- OTTC is not a universal solution to alignment, safety, reliability, or correctness.
- A well‑structured OTTC system can still fail, drift, or produce harmful outputs.

2) **Not determinism**
- OTTC does not make an LLM deterministic.
- It does not guarantee repeatable behavior across runs, seeds, temperatures, or context perturbations.

3) **Not truth**
- OTTC does not guarantee factual accuracy.
- OTTC does not prevent hallucinations; it aims to reduce unsupported claims and make violations detectable and auditable.

4) **Not model‑independent equivalence**
- Different models couple differently to the same constitution.
- OTTC does not guarantee the same semantics, obedience, or stability across model families, versions, or fine-tunes.

5) **Not a replacement for software**
- OTTC does not replace deterministic programming, validators, access controls, or runtime enforcement.
- For high‑stakes use, deterministic verification and external policy gates may still be required.

6) **Not a substitute for oversight**
- OTTC does not eliminate the need for human review, monitoring, evaluation, or incident response.
- Audit artifacts can be performative unless verified.

## What OTTC *does* promise (the honest value)
OTTC’s practical promise is governance and legibility:

- It shifts trust from “the model is reliable” to “the process constrains and audits state change.”
- It makes long‑horizon agent behavior easier to test by focusing evaluation on state deltas, audits, and invariant checks rather than prose.
- It provides a stable interface for combining LLM cognition with external systems (tools, policies, verifiers) without letting stochastic outputs silently mutate durable state.

## Proper Use (how to deploy OTTC responsibly)
Use OTTC when you need one or more of:
- long-horizon stability (reduced drift and thrash)
- explicit authority boundaries (propose vs commit)
- bounded epistemics (observation vs inference vs committed state)
- auditable state evolution (post-hoc accountability)
- tool safety framed as sensor/actuator governance

Do **not** treat OTTC as sufficient by itself when:
- decisions are high-stakes, irreversible, or regulated
- external factual correctness is critical
- you cannot tolerate policy violations even occasionally

In those cases, OTTC should be paired with:
- deterministic validators (schema + invariants)
- explicit tool permissioning and policy gates
- monitoring and evaluation harnesses
- human-in-the-loop review at commit or actuation boundaries

## Coupling Reality (why qualification matters)
OTTC “touches the probability space with language.” Therefore:
- constitutions are interpreted differently across models
- coupling strength varies by model priors and training regime
- even natural language and culture can shift the effective basin geometry

Treat OTTC as a tunable conditioning layer. Measure coupling, do not assume it.
