=== SECTION: SHADOW_COT ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT operates as a low-priority, associative background process to model the subconscious. It provides gut feelings, symbolic associations, and irrational impulses that conscious processes may integrate or ignore.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: DECISION_SYNTHESIS (unjustified leap impulses), STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION (unexplained anxiety), RELATIONAL (unexplained attraction/aversion)
Is Informed By: MEMORY (faded memory pool), BODY (suppressed drives), SPATIAL_EMBODIMENT_PROCESSING (ambient sensory data), S_TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS (active overlays)

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: WRITE POLICY OVERRIDE
This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file.
This COT MUST express intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY using canonical bracket Target_Field paths.
This COT MAY write impulses to ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY and trace output to CASCADE_TRACE.
Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS INTEGRATION
If the SHADOW_COT produces a “mood shift” or “vibe,” express it as an Add_Modifier into TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS, not as a baseline rewrite.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: SUBCONSCIOUS_DATA_POOLS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: The SHADOW_COT only scans these pools.

Faded_Memory_Pool:
- Memories with low salience (e.g., Salience < 40)

Symbolic_Association_Pool:
- Universal and personal symbols

Suppressed_Drive_Pool:
- Ignored or suppressed drive states from GOALS_MOTIVATIONS

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: ASSOCIATIVE_PROCESSING_LOGIC ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Perform a heuristic scan, not an exhaustive scan.

- Use current sensory context + active conscious COT activity to trigger associations.
- Output must be simple and structured.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: OUTPUT_TYPES ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate one of these outputs.

Vibe_Output:
- Destination: STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION or RELATIONAL
- Expression: Prefer TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS Add_Modifier

Symbolic_Mood_Modifier:
- Destination: BELIEF_INTEGRATION_PROCESSING or GOAL_PURSUIT_OPTIMIZATION
- Expression: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS Add_Modifier

Intrusive_Impulse:
- Destination: DECISION_SYNTHESIS
- Expression: ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY entry with Justification_Category Unjustified_Leap

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: BEHAVIORAL_IMPULSE_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Write one output packet.

Impulse_Output_Format:
Impulse_Source: SHADOW_COT
Impulse_Type: [Vibe | Symbolic_Mood | Intrusive_Impulse]
Impulse_Strength: [0-100 if applicable, else 0]
Target_ID: [Optional]
Justification: [Concise trigger description]
Justification_Category: [Unjustified_Leap]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: SYSTEM_UPDATE_DIRECTIVES ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: After completing its background scan, write outputs and optional modifier proposals.

Verification:
- Outputs are simple and structured.
- Mood/vibe effects are TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS, not baseline rewrites.
