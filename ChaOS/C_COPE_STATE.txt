=== SECTION: COPE ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
To store the character's current coping configuration as a persistent state layer. This module holds which coping mechanisms are currently selected or biased, and their probabilities. It does not define the detailed behavioral effects; those remain in P_COPE.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION (coping selection), DECISION_SYNTHESIS (coping impulses), COMMUNICATION_PROCESSING (expression under coping), TEMPORAL_FLOW_PROCESSING (routine coping drift).
Is Informed By: STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION (acute stress), ATTACHMENT_BEHAVIORAL_MAPPING (bias), BELIEF_INTEGRATION_PROCESSING (moral constraints), GOAL_PURSUIT_OPTIMIZATION (drive pressures).

=== SECTION: COPE_PROBABILITY_BIASES ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Probabilities shape which coping impulses are likely under stress. Values are 0-100 and do not need to sum to 100.

ACTIVE_COPING_PROBABILITY: [0-100]

DENIAL_PROBABILITY: [0-100]

=== SECTION: STATE_TRANSITION_LOGIC ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Apply these rules when proposing COPE updates. Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT commits.

ON_ACUTE_STRESS:
- PRIMARY_MECHANISM may shift toward the highest probability bias.
- SECONDARY_MECHANISM becomes the next-best fallback.

ON_STABILIZATION:
- Gradually return probabilities toward baseline if baseline is defined elsewhere.
- Reduce SUBSTANCE_USE_RISK unless SUBSTANCE_USE was selected or cues indicate craving.

ON_SUBSTANCE_USE_EVENT:
- Increase SUBSTANCE_USE_RISK.
- Set PRIMARY_MECHANISM to SUBSTANCE_USE only if explicitly chosen behaviorally.
