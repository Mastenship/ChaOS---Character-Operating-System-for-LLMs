=== SECTION: TEMPORAL_DECAY_RESOLUTION ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT template applies decay to memory, skills, relationships, and physical attributes during significant passages of time. It simulates forgetting, skill atrophy, relational drift, and aging.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: MEMORY, SKILLS, RELATIONAL, BODY, ALTERATIONS
Is Informed By: TEMPORAL_FLOW_PROCESSING (time skip trigger), TEMPORAL_DYNAMICS, narrative time jump context

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: WRITE POLICY OVERRIDE
This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file.
This COT MUST express all intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY using canonical bracket Target_Field paths.
This COT MAY write trace output to CASCADE_TRACE.
Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS INTEGRATION
This COT primarily generates permanent/long-horizon transitions. Temporary modifiers are usually not appropriate here except for “readjustment” periods immediately after a large jump.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: TIME_SKIP_INPUT ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Use the time jump context provided by TEMPORAL_FLOW_PROCESSING.

Time_Passed: [Duration string]
Narrative_Context: [Brief summary]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: MEMORY_DECAY ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: For each applicable [MEM_XX], propose salience/detail adjustments using canonical paths.

Examples:
- Target_Field: [MEMORY][MEM_XX][Memory_Metadata][Salience]
  Operation_Type: Set or Transition (if you treat it ordinal)
- Target_Field: [MEMORY][MEM_XX][Narrative_Content][Internal_Monologue_Excerpt]
  Operation_Type: Set
- Target_Field: [MEMORY][MEM_XX][Narrative_Content][Sensory_Imprint]
  Operation_Type: Set

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: SKILL_ATROPHY ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: For each relevant [SKL_XX], propose step-limited transitions per SKILLS.STATE_TRANSITION_LOGIC.

Targets:
- [SKILLS][SKL_XX][Mastery Level]
- [SKILLS][SKL_XX][Instinct Level]
- [SKILLS][SKL_XX][Growth Potential]
Operation_Type: Transition
Mechanism_Tag: SKILL_STATE_CHANGE

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: RELATIONAL_DRIFT ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: For each relevant [ENT_XX], propose step-limited transitions.

Targets:
- [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Affective_Valence]
  Operation_Type: Transition
- [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Cognitive_Complexity]
  Operation_Type: Transition
- [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Current_Concern]
  Operation_Type: Set

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: PHYSICAL_AGING ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: If time jump is significant (>= 1 year), propose conservative BODY changes using canonical paths.

Possible Targets:
- [BODY][Appearance/Aging][Skin Elasticity]
- [BODY][Appearance/Aging][Hair Density]
- [BODY][Physiological Health][Blood Pressure]
- [BODY][Physiological Health][Heart Rate]
Operation_Type: Set
Justification must reference time jump magnitude.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: ALTERATION_DURATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: For each temporary/conditional [ALT_XX], propose status changes using canonical paths.

Targets:
- [ALTERATIONS][ALT_XX][Status]
  Operation_Type: Transition
- If awareness of fading is important, propose a MEMORY candidate (do not directly create memory here).

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: SYSTEM_UPDATE_DIRECTIVES ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: After completing temporal decay resolution, propose updates using canonical Target_Field paths.

Verification:
- All proposals use canonical [MEMORY][MEM_XX], [SKILLS][SKL_XX], [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX], [ALTERATIONS][ALT_XX], [BODY][...] paths.
- Step limits are respected; do not jump multiple steps without explicit override proof.
