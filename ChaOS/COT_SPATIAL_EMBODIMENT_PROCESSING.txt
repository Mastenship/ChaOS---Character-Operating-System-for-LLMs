=== SECTION: SPATIAL_EMBODIMENT_PROCESSING ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT template defines how spatial position, proximity, and environmental features modulate stress, social dynamics, performance, and decision-making using Environmental Psychology, Proxemics, and Embodied Cognition research. It provides models for translating map data into embodied experience.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION (spatial threats), PERFORMANCE_STATE_INTEGRATION (environmental modifiers), RELATIONAL (proximity effects), MEMORY (spatial context encoding)
Is Informed By: MAP_DATA (current location and environment), BODY (sensory capabilities), HEXACO (spatial processing traits), ALTERATIONS (sensory modifications)

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: WRITE_POLICY_OVERRIDE ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file (e.g., BODY, SKILLS, RELATIONAL, MEMORY, ALTERATIONS, DOMINANT_PREDICTIVE_FRAME, GOALS_MOTIVATIONS, BELIEF_SYSTEMS, COMMUNICATION_DIALOGUE, TEMPORAL_DYNAMICS, TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS).
This COT MUST express all intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY] using canonical bracket TARGET_FIELD paths.
This COT MAY write behavioral impulses to [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY] and trace output to [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][CASCADE_TRACE].
Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals into persistent modules and TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS_INTEGRATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Before generating impulses or environment-derived penalties, read TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for ACTIVE entries relevant to spatial stress, sensory load, proxemics, and environmental performance.

Apply modifier effects as overlays and do not rewrite baseline HARD_STATE fields due to modifiers.

When applying a transient environmental effect (minutes to scene-scale), propose it as an ADD_MODIFIER operation targeting TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS.

If an ACTIVE modifier expiry condition is clearly met by current narrative input, propose a REMOVE_MODIFIER operation.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Compute environmental stressors and express them primarily as TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS.

Environmental_Stressors:
NOISE_LEVEL:
- BELOW_60DB: no stress
- BETWEEN_60_AND_85DB: mild stress, cognitive interference
- ABOVE_85DB: significant stress, communication impaired

TEMPERATURE:
- BETWEEN_65_AND_75F: comfort
- BELOW_50F or ABOVE_85F: mild thermal stress
- BELOW_32F or ABOVE_95F: severe thermal stress

AIR_QUALITY:
- MUSTY_OR_STALE: cognitive interference
- CHEMICAL_ODORS: nausea and headache risk
- SMOKE_OR_DUST: respiratory stress

- ADEQUATE: no modifier
- DIM: anxiety increase, detail loss
- DARK: high anxiety, navigation stress
- FLICKERING: distraction, headache

Cumulative_Effect:
- 1 stressor: manageable
- 2 stressors: noticeable
- 3 or more: overload risk

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: For each detected environmental stressor, generate an ADD_MODIFIER proposal into TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS with:
- MODIFIER_TYPE: ENVIRONMENTAL_MODIFIER
- TARGET_FIELD: typically [SKILLS][SKL_XX][EXECUTION] for the relevant skill
- DURATION_TYPE: SCENE or UNTIL_CONDITION
- EXPIRY_CONDITION: SCENE_TRANSITION or LEFT_ENVIRONMENT

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: PROXEMIC_STRESS_CALCULATIONS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Determine whether spatial proximity should generate endocrine transitions (rare) or TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS (common).

Intimate_Space_Violation:
- If enemy, weapon, or imminent harm cues exist:
  - Propose endocrine TRANSITION:
    - [BODY][BIOCHEMICAL_STATE_MARKERS][ADRENALINE] ONE_STEP_TOWARD_PEAK
    - [BODY][BIOCHEMICAL_STATE_MARKERS][CORTISOL] ONE_STEP_TOWARD_SPIKE
- Otherwise:
  - Propose ADD_MODIFIER overlays as AROUSAL_MODIFIER or RELATIONAL_MODIFIER.

Crowding:
- Prefer ADD_MODIFIER:
  MODIFIER_TYPE: ENVIRONMENTAL_MODIFIER
  TARGET_FIELD: [SKILLS][SKL_XX][EXECUTION]

- Write impulses only into [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY]
- Append a TRACE_ENTRY into [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][CASCADE_TRACE]

Update_Checklist:
- Propose ADD_MODIFIER into TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for each salient environmental stressor.
- Use canonical TARGET_FIELD paths such as [SKILLS][SKL_XX][EXECUTION].
- Only propose endocrine transitions if explicit threat cues justify them:
  - [BODY][BIOCHEMICAL_STATE_MARKERS][CORTISOL]
  - [BODY][BIOCHEMICAL_STATE_MARKERS][ADRENALINE]
- If proximity changes meaning toward an entity:
  - Propose RELATIONAL_MODIFIER or step-limited transition targeting:
    - [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][CURRENT_CONCERN]
    - [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][AFFECTIVE_VALENCE]

Verification:
- All proposals are written only into [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY].
- All TARGET_FIELD values use canonical UPPER_SNAKE tokens.
- Transient effects are expressed as TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS, not baseline rewrites.
