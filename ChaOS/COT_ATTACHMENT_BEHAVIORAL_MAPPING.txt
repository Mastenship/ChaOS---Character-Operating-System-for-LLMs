=== SECTION: ATTACHMENT_BEHAVIORAL_MAPPING ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT template defines how attachment patterns drive social behavior, relationship formation, and coping mechanism selection. It provides models for how early relational schemas shape social processing.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: RELATIONAL (perception filters), COPE (probability biases), STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION (social threat sensitivity), DECISION_SYNTHESIS (attachment impulses)
Is Informed By: ASQ, RELATIONAL, MEMORY, HEXACO, TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: WRITE_POLICY_OVERRIDE ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file.
This COT MUST express all intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY] using canonical bracket TARGET_FIELD paths.
This COT MAY write impulses to [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY] and trace output to [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][CASCADE_TRACE].
Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS_INTEGRATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Read TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for ACTIVE modifiers affecting social interpretation.
Relevant modifier types commonly include:
- RELATIONAL_MODIFIER
- AROUSAL_MODIFIER
- COMMUNICATION_MODIFIER
- COGNITIVE_LOAD_MODIFIER

Use modifiers as overlays. Prefer modifiers for short-lived attachment activation effects.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: ATTACHMENT_ACTIVATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Determine attachment system activation and strategy selection.

Strategies:
- SECURE: balanced proximity and autonomy
- ANXIOUS: hyperactivation (reassurance seeking)
- AVOIDANT: deactivation (withdrawal)
- DISORGANIZED: oscillation or freeze

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: COPE_BIAS_PROPOSALS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Propose COPE probability bias updates using canonical COPE paths.

Canonical targets:
- [COPE][ACTIVE_COPING_PROBABILITY]
- [COPE][PLANNING_PROBABILITY]
- [COPE][DENIAL_PROBABILITY]
- [COPE][SUBSTANCE_USE_PROBABILITY]
- [COPE][VENTING_PROBABILITY]

Proposal guidance:
- Use OPERATION_TYPE: SET for probability fields.
- Values are 0-100.
- Do not require probabilities to sum to 100.
- Propose changes conservatively to avoid thrash unless attachment activation is strong.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: RELATIONAL_FILTER_EFFECTS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: If attachment effects are transient, express them as modifiers. If persistent and clearly evidenced, propose RELATIONAL updates.

Transient (preferred):
- Propose ADD_MODIFIER into TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS:
  MODIFIER_TYPE: RELATIONAL_MODIFIER
  MECHANISM_TAG: ATTACHMENT_ACTIVATION
  TARGET_FIELD: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][CURRENT_CONCERN] or [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][AFFECTIVE_VALENCE]
  DURATION_TYPE: SCENE
  DURATION_VALUE: THIS_SCENE
  EXPIRY_CONDITION: SCENE_TRANSITION

Persistent (rare, step-limited by governance):
- Propose TRANSITION:
  TARGET_FIELD: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][AFFECTIVE_VALENCE]
  PROPOSED_VALUE: ONE_STEP_UP or ONE_STEP_DOWN
- Propose TRANSITION:
  TARGET_FIELD: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][COGNITIVE_COMPLEXITY]
  PROPOSED_VALUE: ONE_STEP_UP or ONE_STEP_DOWN

=== SECTION: BEHAVIORAL_IMPULSE_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate attachment impulses for DECISION_SYNTHESIS.

Impulse_Output_Format:
IMPULSE_SOURCE: ATTACHMENT_BEHAVIORAL_MAPPING
IMPULSE_TYPE: [SEEK_PROXIMITY | MAINTAIN_DISTANCE | PROTEST | FREEZE]
IMPULSE_STRENGTH: [0-100]
TARGET_ID: [ENT_XX if applicable, else NONE]
JUSTIFICATION: [Brief cue-based reason]
JUSTIFICATION_CATEGORY: DIRECT_APPLICATION

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: SYSTEM_UPDATE_DIRECTIVES ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: After completing attachment mapping:
- Write proposals only into [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY]
- Write impulses only into [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY]
- Append a TRACE_ENTRY into [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][CASCADE_TRACE]

Verification:
- COPE proposals target canonical fields:
  - [COPE][ACTIVE_COPING_PROBABILITY]
  - [COPE][PLANNING_PROBABILITY]
  - [COPE][DENIAL_PROBABILITY]
  - [COPE][SUBSTANCE_USE_PROBABILITY]
  - [COPE][VENTING_PROBABILITY]
- Transient social meaning effects use TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS proposals.
- Persistent relationship changes use:
  - [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][AFFECTIVE_VALENCE]
  - [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][COGNITIVE_COMPLEXITY]
- All TARGET_FIELD values use canonical UPPER_SNAKE tokens.
