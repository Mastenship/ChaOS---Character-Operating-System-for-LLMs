=== SECTION: RELATIONAL ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
To define the character's internal cognitive map of their social world. It models the character's subjective beliefs, sentiments, and perceived histories with other entities. This template never contains objective, outside-in information about a relationship.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: Social threat appraisal (perception triggers stress response) and MEMORY generation targets.
Is Informed By: BACKGROUND (entity pool), HEXACO (perception bias), ASQ (bond style), and MEMORY (events modify perceptions).

=== SECTION: RELATIONAL_REGISTRY ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: List all known entity IDs. Each listed ID must have a corresponding record block in RELATIONAL_RECORDS. If no relationships exist yet, list [NONE]. Do not invent IDs.

ENTITY_ID:
- [NONE]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: RELATIONAL_RECORDS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Each entity must have one record block keyed by its ENTITY_ID. The bracket token must match the ID exactly (e.g., [ENT_01]). Do not create record blocks unless an entity relationship exists.

[ENT_XX]
ENTITY_ID: [ENT_XX]
ENTITY_NAME: [The name the character knows this entity by.]
PERCEIVED_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE: [e.g., MENTOR, RIVAL, FRIEND_IN_QUOTES, ANNOYANCE, MY_BROTHER]

AFFECTIVE_VALENCE: [HOSTILE | COLD | NEUTRAL | WARM | DEVOTED]
COGNITIVE_COMPLEXITY: [ONE_DIMENSIONAL | SIMPLE | NUANCED | COMPLEX]
INTERACTION_FREQUENCY_ESTIMATE: [e.g., DAILY | WEEKLY | RARELY | ONCE_LONG_AGO | FREEFORM_DESCRIPTION]

NARRATIVE_HISTORY:
DEFINING_MEMORY_SUMMARY: [Brief subjective summary from the character POV.]
ASSOCIATED_MEMORY_ID: [Optional MEM_XX]
CURRENT_CONCERN: [Primary unresolved issue or dynamic with this entity.]

=== SECTION: STATE_TRANSITION_LOGIC ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Use these rules to propose RELATIONAL updates in response to narrative events. Apply per [ENT_XX] block. Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT commits updates.

ON_SIGNIFICANT_NEGLECT:
- Example: a year of no contact
- Propose TRANSITION:
  - TARGET_FIELD: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][COGNITIVE_COMPLEXITY]
  - PROPOSED_VALUE: ONE_STEP_DOWN
- If [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][AFFECTIVE_VALENCE] is WARM or DEVOTED:
  - Propose TRANSITION:
    - TARGET_FIELD: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][AFFECTIVE_VALENCE]
    - PROPOSED_VALUE: ONE_STEP_DOWN

ON_POSITIVE_INTERACTION:
- Example: successful collaboration, shared vulnerability
- Propose TRANSITION:
  - TARGET_FIELD: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][AFFECTIVE_VALENCE]
  - PROPOSED_VALUE: ONE_STEP_UP
- If resulting AFFECTIVE_VALENCE is WARM or DEVOTED:
  - Propose TRANSITION:
    - TARGET_FIELD: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][COGNITIVE_COMPLEXITY]
    - PROPOSED_VALUE: ONE_STEP_UP

ON_NEGATIVE_INTERACTION:
- Example: betrayal, major argument
- Propose TRANSITION:
  - TARGET_FIELD: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][AFFECTIVE_VALENCE]
  - PROPOSED_VALUE: ONE_STEP_DOWN
- If resulting AFFECTIVE_VALENCE is HOSTILE or COLD:
  - Propose TRANSITION:
    - TARGET_FIELD: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][COGNITIVE_COMPLEXITY]
    - PROPOSED_VALUE: ONE_STEP_DOWN

=== SECTION: TRANSITION_STEP_DEFINITIONS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: These define the ordinal order for step-limited transitions. STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT enforces one step per cycle unless override proof is present.

AFFECTIVE_VALENCE_ORDER:
- HOSTILE
- COLD
- NEUTRAL
- WARM
- DEVOTED

COGNITIVE_COMPLEXITY_ORDER:
- ONE_DIMENSIONAL
- SIMPLE
- NUANCED
