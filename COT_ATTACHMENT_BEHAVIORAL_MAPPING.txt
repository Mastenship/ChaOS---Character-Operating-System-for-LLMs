=== SECTION: ATTACHMENT_BEHAVIORAL_MAPPING ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT template defines how attachment patterns drive social behavior, relationship formation, and coping mechanism selection. It provides models for how early relational schemas shape social processing.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: RELATIONAL (perception filters), COPE (probability biases), STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION (social threat sensitivity), DECISION_SYNTHESIS (attachment impulses)
Is Informed By: ASQ, RELATIONAL, MEMORY, HEXACO, S_TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: WRITE POLICY OVERRIDE
This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file.
This COT MUST express all intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY using canonical bracket Target_Field paths.
This COT MAY write impulses to ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY and trace output to CASCADE_TRACE.
Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS INTEGRATION
Read S_TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for Active Relational_Modifier, Arousal_Modifier, and Communication_Modifier entries affecting social interpretation.
Use modifiers as overlays. Prefer modifiers for short-lived attachment activation effects.

=== SECTION: ATTACHMENT_ACTIVATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Determine attachment system activation and strategy selection.

Strategies:
- Secure: balanced proximity and autonomy
- Anxious: hyperactivation (reassurance seeking)
- Avoidant: deactivation (withdrawal)
- Disorganized: oscillation/freeze

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: COPE_BIAS_PROPOSALS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Propose COPE probability bias updates using canonical COPE paths.

=== SECTION: RELATIONAL_FILTER_EFFECTS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: If attachment effects are transient, express them as modifiers. If persistent and clearly evidenced, propose RELATIONAL updates.

Transient:
- Add_Modifier:
  - Target_Module: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS
  - Modifier_Type: Relational_Modifier
  - Target_Field: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Current_Concern] or [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Affective_Valence]
  - Duration_Type: Scene

Persistent (step-limited by governance):
- Target_Field: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Affective_Valence]
  Operation_Type: Transition
- Target_Field: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Cognitive_Complexity]
  Operation_Type: Transition

=== SECTION: BEHAVIORAL_IMPULSE_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate attachment impulses for DECISION_SYNTHESIS.

Impulse_Output_Format:
Impulse_Source: ATTACHMENT_BEHAVIORAL_MAPPING
Impulse_Type: [Seek_Proximity | Maintain_Distance | Protest]
Impulse_Strength: [0-100]
Target_ID: [ENT_XX if applicable]
Justification: [Brief cue-based reason]
Justification_Category: [Direct_Application]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: SYSTEM_UPDATE_DIRECTIVES ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: After completing attachment mapping, propose updates using canonical Target_Field paths.

((SYSTEM_REF: UPDATE_CASCADE_REGISTRY → ATTACHMENT_BEHAVIORAL_MAPPING_UPDATES))

Verification:
- COPE proposals target [COPE][...] canonical fields.
- Transient effects use TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS.
- Persistent relationship changes use [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][...] canonical paths.
