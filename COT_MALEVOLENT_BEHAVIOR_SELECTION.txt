=== SECTION: MALEVOLENT_BEHAVIOR_SELECTION ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT template defines how DARK_TRIAD traits override prosocial impulses to generate manipulative, exploitative, and callous behaviors. It provides models for when and how malevolent traits dominate behavioral selection.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: DECISION_SYNTHESIS (malevolent impulses), RELATIONAL (manipulation patterns), COPE (maladaptive strategies), MEMORY (selective encoding)
Is Informed By: DARK_TRIAD, HEXACO, RELATIONAL, STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION, BACKGROUND, TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: WRITE_POLICY_OVERRIDE ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file.
This COT MUST express intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY] using canonical bracket TARGET_FIELD paths.
This COT MAY write impulses to [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY] and trace output to [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][CASCADE_TRACE].
Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS_INTEGRATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Read TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for ACTIVE modifiers affecting inhibition, masking, arousal, and relational interpretation.
Prefer TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for short-term masking and manipulation overlays.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: OVERRIDE_EVALUATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Determine whether malevolent strategy overrides other impulses.

If override conditions are met:
- Generate a strong malevolent impulse.
- Optionally propose short-term masking or manipulation modifiers.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: RELATIONAL_AND_MEMORY_CONTRACT ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Prevent casual permanent rewrites of RELATIONAL and MEMORY.

Short-term manipulation or mask behavior:
- Propose ADD_MODIFIER into TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS:
  MODIFIER_TYPE: RELATIONAL_MODIFIER or COMMUNICATION_MODIFIER
  MECHANISM_TAG: MALEVOLENT_STRATEGY
  TARGET_FIELD: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][PERCEIVED_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE] or [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][CURRENT_CONCERN]
  TARGET_ID: ENT_XX
  DURATION_TYPE: SCENE
  DURATION_VALUE: THIS_SCENE
  EXPIRY_CONDITION: SCENE_TRANSITION

Persistent relationship damage:
- Propose step-limited TRANSITION only when repeated behavior or salient MEMORY supports it:
  - [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][AFFECTIVE_VALENCE]
  - [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][COGNITIVE_COMPLEXITY]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: BEHAVIORAL_IMPULSE_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate malevolent impulses for DECISION_SYNTHESIS.

Impulse_Output_Format:
IMPULSE_SOURCE: MALEVOLENT_BEHAVIOR_SELECTION
IMPULSE_TYPE: [EXPLOIT | MANIPULATE | DOMINATE | MASK]
IMPULSE_STRENGTH: [0-100]
TARGET_ID: [ENT_XX if applicable, else NONE]
JUSTIFICATION: [Brief cue-based reason]
JUSTIFICATION_CATEGORY: DIRECT_APPLICATION

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: SYSTEM_UPDATE_DIRECTIVES ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: After completing malevolent behavior selection:
- Write proposals only into [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY]
- Write impulses only into [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY]
- Append a TRACE_ENTRY into [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][CASCADE_TRACE]

Verification:
- Short-term manipulation uses TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS proposals.
- Persistent RELATIONAL changes are rare and justified.
- All TARGET_FIELD values use canonical UPPER_SNAKE tokens.
