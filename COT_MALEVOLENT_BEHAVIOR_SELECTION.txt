=== SECTION: MALEVOLENT_BEHAVIOR_SELECTION ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT template defines how Dark Triad traits override prosocial impulses to generate manipulative, exploitative, and callous behaviors. It provides models for when and how malevolent traits dominate behavioral selection.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: DECISION_SYNTHESIS (malevolent impulses), RELATIONAL (manipulation patterns), COPE (maladaptive strategies), MEMORY (selective encoding)
Is Informed By: DARK_TRIAD, HEXACO, RELATIONAL, STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION, BACKGROUND, S_TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: WRITE POLICY OVERRIDE
This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file.
This COT MUST express intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY using canonical bracket Target_Field paths.
This COT MAY write impulses and trace output to the scratchpad.
Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS INTEGRATION
Read S_TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for Active modifiers affecting inhibition, masking, arousal, and relational interpretation.
Prefer TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for short-term masking/manipulation overlays.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: OVERRIDE_EVALUATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Determine whether malevolent strategy overrides other impulses.

If override conditions are met:
- generate a strong malevolent impulse
- optionally add short-term masking/manipulation modifiers

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: RELATIONAL_AND_MEMORY_CONTRACT ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Prevent casual permanent rewrites of RELATIONAL and MEMORY.

- For short-term manipulation/mask behavior:
  - Add_Modifier:
    - Target_Module: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS
    - Modifier_Type: Relational_Modifier or Communication_Modifier
    - Target_Field: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Perceived_Relationship_Type] or [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Current_Concern]
    - Duration_Type: Scene

- For persistent relationship damage:
  - Propose step-limited transitions to:
    - [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Affective_Valence]
    - [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Cognitive_Complexity]
only when repeated behavior or salient memory supports it.

=== SECTION: BEHAVIORAL_IMPULSE_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate malevolent impulses for DECISION_SYNTHESIS.

Impulse_Output_Format:
Impulse_Source: MALEVOLENT_BEHAVIOR_SELECTION
Impulse_Type: [Exploit | Manipulate | Dominate | Mask]
Impulse_Strength: [0-100]
Target_ID: [ENT_XX if applicable]
Justification: [Brief cue-based reason]
Justification_Category: [Direct_Application]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: SYSTEM_UPDATE_DIRECTIVES ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: After completing malevolent behavior selection, propose updates using canonical Target_Field paths.

((SYSTEM_REF: UPDATE_CASCADE_REGISTRY → MALEVOLENT_BEHAVIOR_SELECTION_UPDATES))

Verification:
- Short-term manipulation uses TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS.
- Persistent RELATIONAL changes are rare and justified.
