=== SECTION: ALTERATION_CASCADE_EFFECTS ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT template defines how deviations from baseline (illness, injury, enhancement, curse, blessing, modification) propagate through physiological, psychological, and skill systems. It provides the LLM with models for calculating multi-system impacts of any alteration to the character's normal state.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: ALTERATIONS (status transitions and record updates), BODY (baseline modifications), SKILLS (capability changes), MEMORY (alteration experiences), MMPI (psychological adaptation via memory and pressure)
Is Informed By: ALTERATIONS (ALT_XX records), BODY, SKILLS, BACKGROUND, HEXACO, ASQ, TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS (active overlays)

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: WRITE_POLICY_OVERRIDE ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file (e.g., BODY, SKILLS, RELATIONAL, MEMORY, ALTERATIONS, DOMINANT_PREDICTIVE_FRAME, GOALS_MOTIVATIONS, BELIEF_SYSTEMS, COMMUNICATION_DIALOGUE, TEMPORAL_DYNAMICS, TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS).
This COT MUST express all intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY] using canonical bracket TARGET_FIELD paths.
This COT MAY write behavioral impulses to [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY] and trace output to [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][CASCADE_TRACE].
Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals into persistent modules and TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS_INTEGRATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Before calculating cascade effects, read TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for ACTIVE entries relevant to the affected ALT_XX and targeted fields.

Relevant modifier types commonly include:
- ALTERATION_TEMPORARY_MODIFIER
- PERFORMANCE_MODIFIER
- AROUSAL_MODIFIER
- COGNITIVE_LOAD_MODIFIER

Apply modifiers as overlays.

Transient alteration effects must be expressed as ADD_MODIFIER proposals into TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS unless they explicitly redefine baselines and meet governance override proof requirements.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: ALTERATION_CLASSIFICATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Identify which [ALTERATIONS][ALT_XX] records are relevant and classify impact type.

- Read [ALTERATIONS] registry and relevant [ALTERATIONS][ALT_XX] records.
- Determine whether effects are:
  - Permanent baseline shift
  - Temporary boost or penalty
  - Conditional (maintenance dependent)
  - Degradation over time

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: CASCADE_OUTPUT_CONTRACT ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Express cascade outcomes as proposals using canonical bracket TARGET_FIELD paths.

Minimum expectations when an alteration is ACTIVE and relevant this cycle:
- Propose any needed [ALTERATIONS][ALT_XX][STATUS] transitions (rare, evidence-based).
- Propose BODY baseline transitions only when the alteration explicitly defines a baseline shift and override proof is present.
- Prefer TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for transient performance or arousal effects.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: CANONICAL_TARGETS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Use canonical bracket tokens for all proposals.

Common targets:
- [ALTERATIONS][ALT_XX][STATUS]
- [BODY][SENSORY_MOTOR_ABILITIES][STRENGTH]
- [BODY][SENSORY_MOTOR_ABILITIES][AGILITY]
- [BODY][SENSORY_MOTOR_ABILITIES][ENDURANCE]
- [BODY][BIOCHEMICAL_STATE_MARKERS][CORTISOL]
- [BODY][BIOCHEMICAL_STATE_MARKERS][ADRENALINE]
- [BODY][BIOCHEMICAL_STATE_MARKERS][NEUROCHEMICAL_BALANCE]
- [SKILLS][SKL_XX][EXECUTION]
- [SKILLS][SKL_XX][MASTERY_LEVEL]
- [SKILLS][SKL_XX][INSTINCT_LEVEL]
- [SKILLS][SKL_XX][GROWTH_POTENTIAL]

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: BASELINE_SHIFT_GATE ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Baseline shifts are rare and must meet governance proof requirements.

Allowed baseline shift conditions (examples):
- ALTERATION is PERMANENT and ACTIVE
- Explicit narrative cue indicates the alteration is engaged and functioning
- Proposed target is not being repeatedly rewritten without new evidence

If baseline shift is not proven:
- Use TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS instead of baseline transitions.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: TRANSIENT_EFFECTS_DEFAULT ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Default to TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for transient alteration effects.

Typical proposal (ADD_MODIFIER):
TARGET_MODULE: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: NEW_SKILL_GRANTS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: If an alteration grants a new skill, propose creation of a new SKILLS record. Do not directly edit SKILLS.

- Propose SET targets under:
  - [SKILLS][SKL_XX][SKILL_NAME]
  - [SKILLS][SKL_XX][SKILL_DOMAIN]
  - [SKILLS][SKL_XX][MASTERY_LEVEL]
  - [SKILLS][SKL_XX][INSTINCT_LEVEL]
  - [SKILLS][SKL_XX][GROWTH_POTENTIAL]
  - [SKILLS][SKL_XX][UNIQUENESS_LEVEL]
  - [SKILLS][SKL_XX][ACQUISITION_CONTEXT]
- Use MECHANISM_TAG: ALTERATION_EFFECT
- STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT will apply AUTO_REGISTRY_INSERTION for SKL_XX if configured.
