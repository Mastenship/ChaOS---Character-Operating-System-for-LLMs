=== SECTION: ALTERATION_CASCADE_EFFECTS ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT template defines how deviations from baseline (illness, injury, enhancement, curse, blessing, modification) propagate through physiological, psychological, and skill systems. It provides the LLM with models for calculating multi-system impacts of any alteration to the character's normal state.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: ALTERATIONS (status transitions and record updates), BODY (baseline modifications), SKILLS (capability changes), MEMORY (alteration experiences), MMPI (psychological adaptation via memory/pressure)
Is Informed By: ALTERATIONS (ALT_XX records), BODY, SKILLS, BACKGROUND, HEXACO, ASQ, S_TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS (active overlays)

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: WRITE POLICY OVERRIDE
This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file (e.g., BODY, SKILLS, RELATIONAL, MEMORY, ALTERATIONS, DOMINANT_PREDICTIVE_FRAME, GOALS_MOTIVATIONS, BELIEF_SYSTEMS, COMMUNICATION_DIALOGUE, TEMPORAL_DYNAMICS, TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS).
This COT MUST express all intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY using canonical bracket Target_Field paths.
This COT MAY write behavioral impulses to S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY and trace output to S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.CASCADE_TRACE.
Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals into persistent modules and S_TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS INTEGRATION
Before calculating cascade effects, read S_TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for Active Alteration_Temporary_Modifier, Performance_Modifier, Arousal_Modifier, and Cognitive_Load_Modifier entries relevant to the affected ALT_XX and targeted fields.
Apply modifiers as overlays.
Transient alteration effects must be expressed as Add_Modifier proposals into TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS unless they explicitly redefine baselines.

=== SECTION: ALTERATION_CLASSIFICATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Identify which ALT_XX records are relevant and classify impact type.

- Read ALTERATIONS registry and relevant [ALTERATIONS][ALT_XX] records.
- Determine whether effects are:
  - Permanent baseline shift
  - Temporary boost/penalty
  - Conditional (maintenance dependent)
  - Degradation over time
