=== SECTION: TEMPORAL_DYNAMICS ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This template defines the character's temporal patterns, circadian rhythms, habitual behaviors, and time perception using chronobiology, behavioral psychology, and temporal cognition research. It manages how the character experiences and responds to time's passage without requiring explicit timestamps.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: BODY (circadian hormone cycles), SKILLS (time-of-day performance), GOALS_MOTIVATIONS (routine goals), DECISION_SYNTHESIS (habitual choices)
Is Informed By: BACKGROUND (cultural time norms), MEMORY (temporal landmarks), ALTERATIONS (modified sleep needs), STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION (time perception distortion)
