# OTTC (On‑The‑Top Constraint) Systems — Enterprise Governance / Safety Rendering

## Executive summary
OTTC is a governance-first architecture for LLM agents. It uses a versioned, human-readable constitution (plain text) to constrain what an agent can claim, what it can change, and how changes are audited. OTTC is designed for long-running agents operating under uncertainty where overreach and state drift are costly.

OTTC does not claim determinism. It makes stochastic behavior bounded, reviewable, and testable.

## The enterprise risk OTTC targets
Agents fail in predictable governance-relevant ways:
- Fabrication of facts or sources (hallucinated authority)
- Uncontrolled changes to internal state (“policy drift”)
- Inability to explain why actions were taken
- Fragile coupling to deterministic systems (tickets, deployments, approvals)
- Accumulating “soft errors” that become major failures over time

OTTC introduces change control and accountability as first-class requirements.

## OTTC controls (mapped to governance concerns)

### 1) Defined state surfaces (ontology)
OTTC defines “what the agent is allowed to remember and mutate” using canonical addresses.
Governance benefit:
- supports reviews, approvals, and limits on what can persist

### 2) Change control via propose→commit
Agent components may propose updates; only a single governed authority commits them.
Governance benefit:
- prevents uncontrolled mutation
- enables approval gates and human-in-the-loop escalation at the commit point

### 3) Invariants and step limits
Hard-state fields have step limits and invariant constraints; risky jumps require explicit proof.
Governance benefit:
- prevents sudden shifts in risk posture, policy interpretation, or “goals”
- reduces “agent drift” across long deployments

### 4) Separation of baseline vs transient modifiers
Short-lived influences must expire and cannot silently rewrite baselines.
Governance benefit:
- prevents a transient incident from permanently shifting the agent’s operating posture without review

### 5) Epistemic boundaries (bounded authority)
OTTC restricts what the agent may assert as fact. External claims can be required to carry evidence pointers (tool outputs, citations, approvals).
Governance benefit:
- reduces misinformation risk
- improves compliance in regulated environments

### 6) Audit + verification
Every proposed state change must be logged as committed/suppressed/downgraded, and verified against caps/invariants.
Governance benefit:
- post-incident forensics become possible
- supports internal controls, compliance evidence, and regression testing

## How OTTC improves tool safety
OTTC treats tools as:
- sensors (evidence acquisition)
- actuators (world-changing actions)

Actuators can be gated by:
- explicit policy invariants
- approvals
- risk posture state
- uncertainty thresholds

This supports “safe actuation” under uncertainty and prevents premature irreversible actions.

## Operationalization
OTTC can be adopted incrementally:
1) Start with epistemic boundaries + evidence requirements.
2) Add propose→commit with a governor.
3) Add audit requirements and verification checks.
4) Add modifier layer and step limits for long-horizon stability.

## What success looks like (measurable outcomes)
- Lower rate of unsupported factual claims
- Lower long-horizon drift in agent state
- Improved incident review quality (why did it do that?)
- Higher reproducibility in replay tests
- Clearer separation of transient vs baseline behavior changes

## Tradeoffs
- Additional context and process overhead
- More up-front design of state surfaces and invariants
- Some loss of improvisational flexibility

## Bottom line
OTTC provides a governance protocol for stochastic agents: explicit state surfaces, controlled mutation, bounded authority, and auditability. It enables deployment of long-running agents with change control comparable to established enterprise practices.
