# OTTC (On‑The‑Top Constraint) Systems — Academic ML / LLM Research Rendering

## Abstract
We propose OTTC: a language-native constraint superstructure for long-horizon, stateful LLM agents. OTTC does not modify model weights and does not claim determinism. Instead, it conditions generation with a versioned “constitution” that defines (i) an addressable state ontology, (ii) governed state mutation via propose→commit, (iii) epistemic boundaries on claims, and (iv) audit+verification requirements. The result is a measurable reduction in state drift and overclaiming through distribution shaping: canonical tokens, enumerated state options, step-limited transitions, and post-hoc verifiers act as high-gravity attractors that constrain reachable continuations.

## Motivation
Long-running LLM agents exhibit recurring failure modes: semantic drift in memory, uncontrolled mutation across subsystems, hallucinated authority, and uninspectable decision-making. Standard prompt-only approaches under-specify update semantics; standard tool-agent stacks often log actions but lack a formally enforced change-control protocol for internal state.

## OTTC: Core Construct
OTTC is a bundle of text artifacts that jointly define agent operating constraints:

1) Addressable ontology (canonical state addresses)
- A canonical address space for commit-worthy “levers.”
- Purpose: reduce synonym drift and stabilize referents across time.

2) Propose→commit governance boundary
- Multiple reasoning passes may propose deltas; only a single governor commits state updates.
- Purpose: isolate stochastic deliberation from durable state.

3) Update law (invariants, step limits, conflict policy)
- Dial classification (hard state vs soft modifiers)
- Step limits for hard state
- Deterministic conflict resolution
- Injection-defense boundary conditions

4) Persistent modifier layer
- Time-bounded overlays (arousal, fatigue, noise, pressure) with expiry semantics.
- Purpose: preserve baseline identity while allowing context sensitivity.

5) Epistemic output contract
- Constraints on what can be asserted as fact vs labeled inference.
- Purpose: reduce “assistant omniscience” and external-fact hallucination.

6) Predictive ledger (hypothesis discipline)
- Explicit hypotheses/predictions with certainty and falsification/resolution states.
- Purpose: represent uncertainty structurally rather than via implicit tone.

7) Audit + verification
- Every proposal accounted for (committed/suppressed/downgraded).
- Post-commit checks for caps, invariants, integrity.
- Purpose: enable mechanized evaluation.

## Research Contributions (as testable claims)
1) Constitution-as-conditioning reduces drift
Hypothesis: canonical addressing + update law yields lower long-horizon semantic drift vs baseline prompt-only agents, measurable by:
- rewrite rate of stable fields
- registry/record integrity violations
- divergence in repeated scenario replays

2) Epistemic contracts reduce overclaiming
Hypothesis: bounded-claim rules reduce unsupported factual assertions; measure:
- unsupported named-entity claims
- confidence calibration metrics under tool/no-tool conditions

3) Auditability enables mechanizable agent evaluation
Hypothesis: OTTC yields more stable evaluation targets (deltas, audits) than freeform transcripts; measure:
- inter-rater reliability on “behavior correctness”
- automated invariant pass rates

## Experimental Setup (suggested)
- Treat constitution variants as experimental conditions.
- Run multi-model evaluation (distribution portability): different model families and RLHF regimes.
- Ablations:
  - remove modifier layer
  - remove step limits
  - remove predictive ledger
  - remove verification pass
- Metrics:
  - state drift rate
  - thrash frequency (repeated conflicting updates)
  - hallucinated authority rate
  - audit completeness
  - recovery after contradiction events

## Relation to Prior Work (high-level)
OTTC intersects with:
- structured memory and event sourcing for agents
- program-of-thought / procedural prompting
- verification and policy enforcement layers
But differs by treating governance, epistemics, and audit as a unified, shippable text constitution.

## Limitations
- Model-dependent coupling: same constitution induces different behavior across models.
- Context budget overhead.
- OTTC constrains reachable behaviors; may reduce creativity/flexibility.

## Conclusion
OTTC reframes long-horizon agent reliability as a constitutional conditioning problem with mechanized accountability. It offers a researchable interface between stochastic policies and governed state transitions, enabling reproducible evaluation via replayable deltas and audits.
