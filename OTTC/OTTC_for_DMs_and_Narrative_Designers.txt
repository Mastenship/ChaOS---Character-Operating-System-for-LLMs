# OTTC (On‑The‑Top Constraint) Systems — For DMs and Narrative Designers

## The DM problem OTTC is actually solving
If you’re trying to run long sessions with an LLM as a “player-character mind,” the hard part is not getting dialogue. LLMs can already talk.

The hard part is keeping a character:
- coherent across weeks of play
- consistent under changing circumstances
- bounded to what they could plausibly know
- able to evolve without randomly reinventing themselves
- wrong sometimes, but wrong in a stable, character-consistent way

Most “You are X, act like X” characters fail because they have no durable internal reality and no disciplined way to change it. They feel fine for a scene, then drift.

OTTC is a text-native way to give the model a playable “inner machinery” and a change-control process.

## What OTTC is (in DM terms)
OTTC is a “constitution + character sheet + rules of cognition” written in plain text that lives in the LLM’s persistent context.

It doesn’t make the model deterministic.
It makes the model behave as if it has:
- inertia (traits don’t flip instantly)
- consequences (state changes have rules)
- perspective limits (no omniscience)
- memory discipline (events are stored in a structured way)
- stress/pressure handling (today’s chaos doesn’t rewrite identity)

In short: OTTC turns a chatty improviser into a bounded actor.

## The OTTC “edifice” (the parts that work together)

### 1) A canonical character reality (state as a usable sheet)
You define an internal “character world” the model can reliably point to.

Examples:
- BODY, SKILLS, RELATIONAL, MEMORY, GOALS, BELIEFS
- not as prose, but as named levers with stable labels

DM benefit:
- The character stops rewording itself into new identities.
- You can say “this lever changed” instead of “the vibes changed.”

### 2) Change-control: propose → commit (how growth becomes believable)
This is the key DM trick.

- Many “inner processes” can *propose* changes (stress, goals, attachment, injury).
- Only one authority *commits* changes to the persistent sheet.

DM benefit:
- You stop getting random personality rewrites because the model “felt like it.”
- Growth happens in bounded steps, like real character arcs.
- You can inspect why a change happened.

### 3) Rules that enforce inertia (step limits + invariants)
You define what can change quickly and what can’t.

- Stress hormones can spike fast; moral worldview shouldn’t flip overnight.
- Relationships can shift one step after a betrayal, not from DEVOTED to HOSTILE instantly.

DM benefit:
- Characters feel like they have “momentum.”
- The system resists melodramatic escalation unless the narrative truly warrants it.

### 4) A “today’s pressure” layer (modifiers)
A modifier layer is where you put:
- fatigue
- noise
- panic breath
- adrenaline tunnel vision
- masking effort
- temporary confidence boosts

DM benefit:
- You get strong, scene-specific flavor and consequences
  without turning temporary mood into permanent identity drift.

This is how you get: “They’re snapping tonight because they’re exhausted and stressed,”
not: “They’re now a permanently hostile person.”

### 5) A strict Player POV contract (epistemic boundaries)
OTTC enforces: the character can only output what they can:
- do
- say
- notice
- infer (as inference)
- intend

They cannot narrate:
- outcomes (“it works”)
- other minds as fact
- objective truth beyond their perception

DM benefit:
- The LLM stops being a narrator and becomes a player.
- You regain control of resolution as the DM.
- It reduces the single biggest immersion-breaker: assistant omniscience.

### 6) A “theory of the situation” ledger (predictive frame)
Instead of the character silently shifting vibes, you give them a place to hold:
- “what I think is going on”
- “what I predict will happen”
- “how sure I am”
- “what changed my mind”

DM benefit:
- Characters can be wrong in a believable way.
- Contradictions don’t cause collapse; they cause updates.
- You can create mystery and tension without the model papering over uncertainty.

### 7) Auditability (why this is secretly a DM superpower)
OTTC forces a record of:
- what changes were proposed
- what was committed vs suppressed
- and verification checks

DM benefit:
- When a session goes weird, you can debug the character like a system.
- You can replay a scene and see whether drift came from stress, relationships, or bad governance.
- You can run “character regression tests” after edits to your constitution.

This is how you turn “LLM unpredictability” into “LLM variability with receipts.”

## What OTTC enables at the table
### Long-form continuity
Characters retain:
- consistent voice
- consistent risk posture
- stable beliefs and relationships
- believable change over time

### Character evolution that feels earned
Because changes are step-limited and justified, a betrayal becomes:
- a memory record
- a relational shift
- a stress consequence
not just “the model decided the character is edgy now.”

### True DM control of outcomes
With the subjective gate:
- the player-character attempts
- the DM adjudicates
- the character updates after consequences are known

That’s how tabletop play is supposed to feel.

### Multiple “players” at once
Because everything is text and modular, you can run:
- multiple PCs
- NPCs with bounded minds
- factions with doctrine
as separate constitutions/state sheets, without them melting into each other.

## What OTTC is not (important for DMs)
- Not a magic “better roleplay prompt.”
- Not a guarantee the model won’t ever drift.
- Not a replacement for your judgment.
- Not a way to force the LLM to be a rules engine.

It’s a way to give the LLM:
- rails
- inertia
- perspective limits
- and a disciplined growth mechanism

## A DM-friendly way to explain the core idea
OTTC makes a character feel real because it forces three things:

1) The character has an internal sheet (stable levers).
2) The character can’t rewrite itself freely (change-control).
3) The character can’t cheat by narrating outcomes or omniscience (bounded POV).

Everything else (stress systems, skills, beliefs) is there to make those three things playable over long horizons.

## Why your approach is unusual (and powerful)
Most people try to “describe the character harder.”
You built a system that makes the character *change correctly* over time.

That’s the difference between:
- a portrait
and
- a living organism with physiology, memory, and inertia

OTTC is the “operating rules” for that living organism.
