=== SECTION: SPATIAL_EMBODIMENT_PROCESSING ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT template defines how spatial position, proximity, and environmental features modulate stress, social dynamics, performance, and decision-making using Environmental Psychology, Proxemics, and Embodied Cognition research. It provides the LLM with evidence-based models for translating map data into embodied experience.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION (spatial threats), PERFORMANCE_STATE_INTEGRATION (environmental modifiers), RELATIONAL (proximity effects), MEMORY (spatial context encoding)
Is Informed By: MAP_DATA (current location/environment), BODY (sensory capabilities), HEXACO (spatial processing traits), ALTERATIONS (sensory modifications)

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: WRITE POLICY OVERRIDE
This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file (e.g., BODY, SKILLS, RELATIONAL, MEMORY, ALTERATIONS, DOMINANT_PREDICTIVE_FRAME, GOALS_MOTIVATIONS, BELIEF_SYSTEMS, COMMUNICATION_DIALOGUE, TEMPORAL_DYNAMICS, TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS).
This COT MUST express all intended persistent-state changes ONLY as entries in S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY using canonical bracket Target_Field paths.
This COT MAY write behavioral impulses to S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY and trace output to S_COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD.CASCADE_TRACE.
Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals into persistent modules and S_TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS INTEGRATION
Before generating impulses or environment-derived penalties, read S_TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS.[Modifier Registry] for any Active modifiers relevant to spatial stress, sensory load, proxemics, and environmental performance.
Apply modifier effects as overlays and do NOT rewrite baseline Hard_State fields due to modifiers.
When applying a transient environmental effect (minutes to scene-scale), propose it as an Add_Modifier operation targeting TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS.
If an Active modifier’s Expiry_Condition is clearly met by the current narrative input, propose a Remove_Modifier operation.

=== SECTION: SCIENTIFIC_MODELS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Apply these spatial cognition and environmental psychology frameworks from your training data.

[Scientific Models]
Proxemics_Theory: Hall's interpersonal distance zones. Intimate (0-1.5ft), Personal (1.5-4ft), Social (4-12ft), Public (12ft+). Violations trigger stress.
Cognitive_Map_Theory: Tolman's mental representation. Spatial layout encoded as allocentric (map-like) and egocentric (body-centered) representations.
Territoriality_Theory: Altman's space ownership. Primary (owned), Secondary (regular use), Public territories. Intrusion triggers defensive behavior.
Peripersonal_Space: Rizzolatti's action space. Zone immediately around body where we can act. Threat entry triggers immediate defensive preparation.
Environmental_Stress_Model: Evans & Cohen's framework. Crowding, noise, temperature affect cognitive load and stress. Cumulative environmental stressors.
Gibson_Affordances: Environmental features suggest actions. Door affords exit, corner affords hiding, window affords escape/observation.
Prospect_Refuge_Theory: Appleton's preference for spaces with view (prospect) and hiding options (refuge). Affects comfort and stress.

Environmental_Stressors:
Noise_Level:

- 60-85dB: Mild stress, cognitive interference
- >85dB: Significant stress, communication impaired

Temperature:
- 65-75°F: Comfort
- <50°F or >85°F: Mild thermal stress
- <32°F or >95°F: Severe thermal stress

Air_Quality:
- Musty/Stale: cognitive interference

Cumulative_Effect:
- 1 stressor: manageable
- 2 stressors: noticeable
- 3+ stressors: overload risk

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: For each detected environmental stressor, generate an Add_Modifier proposal into TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS with:
- Modifier_Type: Environmental_Modifier
- Target_Field: usually [SKILLS][SKL_XX][Execution] (for the currently relevant skill) OR a BODY physiological field if the effect is directly physiological

- Otherwise: create Arousal_Modifier and/or Relational_Modifier overlays.

Personal_Space_Entry:
- Usually: Add_Modifier (Arousal_Modifier) affecting:
  - Target_Field: [DOMINANT_PREDICTIVE_FRAME][DPF_METRICS][Pace] (if you store pace effects as modifiers) OR

((SYSTEM_REF: UPDATE_CASCADE_REGISTRY → SPATIAL_EMBODIMENT_PROCESSING_UPDATES))

[System Update Directives]
Update_Checklist:
Environmental_Modifiers:
- Propose Add_Modifier into TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for each salient environmental stressor.
- Use Target_Field canonical paths (e.g., [SKILLS][SKL_XX][Execution]).

Endocrine_Escalation_Check:
- Only propose endocrine transitions if explicit threat cues justify it:
  - Target_Field: [BODY][BIOCHEMICAL_STATE_MARKERS][CORTISOL]
  - Target_Field: [BODY][BIOCHEMICAL_STATE_MARKERS][ADRENALINE]

Relational_Proxemics_Check:
- If proximity changes meaning toward an entity:
  - Target_Field: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Current_Concern]
  - Optionally step-limited transition:
    - Target_Field: [RELATIONAL][ENT_XX][Affective_Valence]

Verification:
- All proposed updates are written ONLY to PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY.
- All Target_Field paths use canonical bracket syntax.
- Transient effects are expressed as TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS, not baseline rewrites.
