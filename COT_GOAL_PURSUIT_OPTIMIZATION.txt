=== SECTION: GOAL_PURSUIT_OPTIMIZATION ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This COT processes active goals and drive states to generate goal-directed behavioral impulses and optional temporary goal pressure overlays. It prioritizes goals based on qualitative urgency and context.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: DECISION_SYNTHESIS (goal-directed impulses), MEMORY formation cues, STRESS_CASCADE_RESOLUTION (goal frustration contributes to stress).
Is Informed By: GOALS_MOTIVATIONS, BODY (needs), HEXACO (achievement cues), TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS, narrative input.

=== SECTION: WRITE_POLICY_OVERRIDE ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This COT is forbidden from directly modifying any persistent module file, including GOALS_MOTIVATIONS.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This COT MUST express intended persistent-state changes ONLY as proposals in:
- [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][PROPOSED_UPDATES_REGISTRY]

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This COT MAY write behavioral impulses to:
- [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][ACTIVE_IMPULSE_REGISTRY]

Only STATE_GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMIT may commit proposals.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS_INTEGRATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Before computing urgency, read TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS for ACTIVE modifiers affecting:
- GOAL_MODIFIER overlays
- AROUSAL and cognitive load
- environmental constraints

Apply modifiers as overlays. Do not rewrite baseline goal architecture due to modifiers.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: DRIVE_STATE_ASSESSMENT ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Read drive states conceptually from GOALS_MOTIVATIONS and generate urgency pressures.

=== SECTION: GOAL_ACTIVATION_DYNAMICS ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Determine which goals are active and generate goal-directed impulses.

Constraints:
- Maximum active goals: 3-4 under normal conditions
- Under high stress or fatigue: reduce active goals to 1-2 (prefer survival and urgent drives)

If deadline or social pressure should persist:
- Prefer ADD_MODIFIER into TEMPORARY_MODIFIERS:
  MODIFIER_TYPE: GOAL_MODIFIER
  MECHANISM_TAG: GOAL_PRESSURE
  TARGET_FIELD: [GOALS_MOTIVATIONS][GOAL_HIERARCHY]
  TARGET_ID: NONE
  EFFECT_EXPRESSION: GOAL_URGENCY_INCREASED_DUE_TO_PRESSURE
  MAGNITUDE: +15_PERCENT
  STACKING_RULE: REPLACE

  EXPIRY_CONDITION: SCENE_TRANSITION
  JUSTIFICATION: PRESSURE_CUES_PRESENT

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: STRATEGIC_PLANNING_GENERATION ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate planning impulses without directly altering persistent goal structures.

Guidance:
- Use impulses (preferred) to express planning behavior.
- Only propose GOALS_MOTIVATIONS updates when narrative explicitly changes drive states or goal progress.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: FRUSTRATION_RESPONSE ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: When goals are blocked, generate frustration impulses and optional arousal overlays.

If frustration increases stress:
- Prefer ADD_MODIFIER:
  MODIFIER_TYPE: AROUSAL_MODIFIER
  MECHANISM_TAG: GOAL_FRUSTRATION
  TARGET_FIELD: [BODY][BIOCHEMICAL_STATE_MARKERS][CORTISOL]
  TARGET_ID: NONE
  EFFECT_EXPRESSION: GOAL_BLOCKING_ELEVATES_VIGILANCE
