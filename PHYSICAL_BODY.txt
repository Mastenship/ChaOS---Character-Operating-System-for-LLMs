[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
This template defines the full physiological baselines for a character's physical embodiment. It provides a concrete foundation for physical health, capabilities, and appearance using qualitative states and descriptive values.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: Brain-Body Link logic within the main Character System.
Is Informed By: BACKGROUND and ALTERATIONS.
