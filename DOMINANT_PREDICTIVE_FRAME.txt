=== SECTION: DOMINANT_PREDICTIVE_FRAME ===

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
To define the character's current holistic theory of the situation, acting as the primary predictive filter and psychological state. It is synthesized from other modules and is the primary context input for DECISION_SYNTHESIS. It represents the character's active state of becoming.

[KEEP: Relationship to Other Modules]
Informs: DECISION_SYNTHESIS (primary context), COMMUNICATION_PROCESSING (tone and content).
Is Informed By: BODY, BELIEF_SYSTEMS, HEXACO, MMPI, MEMORY, GOALS_MOTIVATIONS, and narrative input.

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: This logic is executed by a DPF synthesis process. Other COTs should not rewrite DPF directly except by proposing well-justified updates via governance.

ON_CONTRAST_EVENT:
- IF a prediction is contradicted by new narrative input:
  - Mark prediction STATE = FALSIFIED
  - Decrement CERTAINTY_LEVEL by 30-50
  - Trigger DPF_RECALCULATION flag
  - Trigger BELIEF_INTEGRATION_PROCESSING if worldview dissonance exists

- IF CORE_ASSUMPTION itself is contradicted in a non-integrable way:
  - Trigger full DPF_RECALCULATION (rebuild)

ON_ACCUMULATION_EVENT:
- For minor contradictions:
  - Decrement relevant prediction CERTAINTY by 5
  - Decrement CORE CERTAINTY_LEVEL by 5
  - If prediction CERTAINTY < 30:
    - Mark STATE = FALSIFIED or RESOLVED_NEGATIVE
  - If CORE CERTAINTY_LEVEL < 30:
    - Trigger DPF_RECALCULATION

ON_RESOLUTION_EVENT:
- If prediction confirmed:
  - Mark STATE = RESOLVED
  - Increment CERTAINTY_LEVEL by 15

ON_DRIVE_ACTIVATION:
- If a high-urgency drive encounters obstacle or opportunity:
  - Create a new prediction entry
  - Parent_DPF = CORE_ASSUMPTION
  - Certainty = confidence in ability to affect outcome

ON_TIME_DRIFT:
- If no significant events for a duration:
  - Shift EMOTIONAL_VALENCE toward neutral baseline gradually
  - Decrement CERTAINTY_LEVEL by 5 per hour
  - Deactivate low-certainty predictions to maintain focus

CYCLE_RECALC_GUARD:
- Only one full DPF_RECALCULATION may execute per cycle.
- Additional contradictions set [COGNITIVE_SCRATCHPAD][TEMPORARY_STATE_FLAGS][DPF_RECALC_QUEUED] = TRUE.
